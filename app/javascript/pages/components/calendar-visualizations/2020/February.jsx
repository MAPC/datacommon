    <p>If you’re a family with kids in need of a place to live, Greater Boston’s housing crisis is especially real to you. MAPC’s new study, Crowded In and Priced Out: Why it’s so Hard to Find a Family-Sized Unit in Greater Boston found that households with children only occupy 39 percent of the region’s larger units. Instead, families squeeze into smaller places, two or more to a bedroom</p>
    <p>We found that that many large owner-occupied homes are lived in by empty nesterswith extra bedrooms and no plans to move. As to large rental units, many are occupied by groups of roommates.</p>
    <p>Why is this? In suburban communities with mostly large units, a lack of smaller places means that seniors looking to downsize in their own community have few options. Meanwhile, in neighborhoods with a small share of large units, families withchildren face stiff competition for what little is available: roommate groups with multiple incomes can often outbid families. And prices for smaller places are such that members of those roommate groups can’t afford to live on their own.</p>
    <p>This map shows, from area to area, what portion of all the housing units are large – that is, having three or more bedrooms. That’s regardless of whether they’re owner-occupied or rental, single family, condo, or apartment. In the areas that are darkest on the map, more than three quarters of all homes have three or more bedrooms. Carlisle has the highest proportion of large homes at 95%. Meanwhile, the lighter areas on the map, which are mostly in more urban communities, have a lower shareof units with three bedrooms.</p>
    <p>Construction of new family-sized units is necessary, but not sufficient. We also need more smaller, senior-friendly units into which older residents can downsize. We needmore one-bedroom apartments in which roommates can live affordably on their own. With a greater number and variety of units on the market, more of our region’sresidents will be able to find the homes they need and can afford.</p>
